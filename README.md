Internship Assignment Projects
This repository contains the solutions for my internship assignment, focused on text analysis, sentiment analysis, and chatbot development using Python and NLP libraries. The tasks were designed to apply data science, machine learning, and natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

Task 1: Text Analysis of "The Difference Between Manga and Manhwa"
In this task, I performed basic text analysis on a provided document. The goal was to count the number of words and the occurrences of specific keywords related to the topic. This task demonstrates proficiency in text manipulation, data extraction, and Python scripting.

Task 2: Sentiment Analysis on User Comments for "The Difference Between Manga and Manhwa"
This task involved performing sentiment analysis on user comments related to the topic "The Difference Between Manga and Manhwa". I used a rule-based approach and the TextBlob library to classify comments as positive, negative, or neutral. The output includes a summary of the sentiment distribution and the ability to display individual comments based on their sentiment classification.

Task 3: Basic Chatbot for "Castle Swimmer Chapter 83-89: Unveiling New Prophecy"
For this task, I developed a basic chatbot using Python and NLTK. The chatbot is able to answer simple questions about the comic "Castle Swimmer", such as what it's about and who the main characters are. The chatbot uses keyword detection to provide relevant responses to user inputs.
